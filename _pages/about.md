I am currently a Research Intern at [Cure Violence Global](https://cvg.org/). As a diligent researcher, I am skilled at internet-based research, data entry, and writing. I have a BA in International Relations from American University. I took courses in data analysis, international development, and religious studies. I am passionate about social justice issues and microeconomic policies. 

Outside of the professional sphere, I am an avid reader and organize monthly book clubs for engaging discussions. Also, I love learning languages and I currently using Duolingo for Hindi lessons.
